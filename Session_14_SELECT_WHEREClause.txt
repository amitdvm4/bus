Understanding WHERE
---------------------

WHERE clause : is used to filter the records based on a condition
: is logically proccessed after FROM clause

WHERE <condition>

LSEXPR <RO> RSEXPR

SQL Server has different relational operators
	= , >, >=, < , <=, <> and also != for not equals 

	a. IS NULL : used to compare with NULL values ( the negation is IS NOT NULL )
	b. IN : is used to compare with the list of values
			should be enclosed in parenthesis ( NOT IN )
	c. BETWEEN .. AND .. : is used to compare with the range of values

		BETWEEN <LBV> AND <UBV>
	d. LIKE :

	

the condition will be checked for every row in the source
condition returns there possible values
	1. TRUE
	2. FALSE
	3. UNKNOWN
for whichever the condition returns TRUE, that rows will displayed in the output
FALSE and UNKNOWN will be rejected
-- dispolay the employees who are working in dept 10

SELECT *
FROM Employee
WHERE DeptId = 10

10 = 10 --> TRUE : Display
20 = 10 --> FALSE : Rejected
20 = 10 --> FALSE : Rejected
10 = 10 --> TRUE : Display
NULL = 10 --> UNKNOWN : Rejected
10 = 10 --> TRUE : Display

UPDATE Employee SET DeptId =  NULL WHERE Empid = 5

LSEXPR <RO> RSEXPR
		
		colName/ constant / salary * 12

DeptId = 10
10 = 10
salary = commission

salary * 12 = 1000


SELECT *
FROM Employee
WHERE 10 = 10


---------  DB Script --------

SELECT * 
FROM Employee

-- display all the employee whose salary is more than 4000
SELECT *

WHERE Salary > 4000



SELECT *

UPDATE Employee SET DeptId = 30 WHERE EmpId = 6

-- Display all the employees who work for departnents other than 10

SELECT *

WHERE DeptId <> 10 -- Standarad SQL -- best practice
--WHERE DeptId != 10 -- Sql server specific

INSERT INTO Employee Values(7,'Hari','SE',4500,Getdate(),NULL);

-- display the employee whose deptid is NULL
SELECT *

WHERE DeptId = NULL --- Empty rows ( surprising result )


IS NULL operator : used to compare with NULL values

SELECT *

WHERE DeptId IS NULL


-- displayees who are assigned with some departments

SELECT *

SELECT *
FROM Employee
WHERE Salary = 5000,1200,7000


SELECT *

WHERE Salary IN (5000,1200,7000)


SELECT *
FROM Employee
WHERE Salary NOT IN (5000,1200,7000)

-- display all the employees who salary is between 1000 to 5000
SELECT *

WHERE salary Between 1000 AND 5000 -- ( the values are inclusive )


SELECT *
